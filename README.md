- **Application**: Keyword extraction, document categorization, semantic search

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Requirements Gathering**
   - Collaborate with FN team, Castro, Brett M C1C USAF USAFA CW/CS31, and Glojek, William J Lt Col USAF USAFA CW/DO to finalize requirements.

2. **Design**
   - Architect the platform structure, user interface, and experience.
   - Plan the AI model for search functionality, considering accuracy and performance.

3. **Development**
   - Set up the development environment and toolchain.
   - Develop the web interface, backend services, and integrate the AI search module.

4. **Testing**
   - Conduct thorough testing for functionality, usability, and security.
   - Perform AI model validation and adjustments for optimal search results.

5. **Deployment**
   - Prepare the production environment and deploy the platform.
   - Upload initial documents and perform a live test of all features.

6. **Training and Documentation**
   - Provide training for administrators on document upload and platform management.
   - Create user documentation for navigating and using the search functionality.

7. **Maintenance and Updates**
   - Establish a routine for document updates and platform maintenance.
   - Monitor performance and user feedback for future improvements.

#### Maintenance Plan

- Regularly upload new documents and update existing ones.
- Perform bug fixes and platform improvements based on user feedback.
- Ensure the AI search model remains accurate and efficient, with occasional retraining or updates as needed.

#### Conclusion

This project aims to significantly improve the accessibility and usability of important documents for the USAFA CW, leveraging advanced AI for deep content understanding and searchability. By following the outlined steps and considerations, the FN team, along with the guidance and support from USAFA leadership, can successfully implement this valuable resource within the proposed timeframe.
